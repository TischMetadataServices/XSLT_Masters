It is lavishly illustrated with lively pen and ink drawings for each psalm. The miniatures consist of outline drawings in plain bistre, a technique which gained popularity in the Carolingian Renaissance; it was cheaper than full colored illustrations and quicker to produce. However the Gospel book still remained the main focus of illumination at this period, and the Utrecht Psalter is highly unusual both in the number of illustrations, their size, and the large groups of small figures they contain. The style of the outline drawings is dramatic, marked by activity, leaping creatures and fluttering folds of drapery set in faintly sketched landscape backgrounds stretching the full span of a page. Several different episodes may be shown in an illustration, some interpreting the text very literally, indeed over-literally in typical medieval fashion, others building on an association with the text to create elaborate images, including New Testament scenes or motifs from Christian iconography.

The king has various royal attributes: a crown and fillet, covered globe, nimbus with beaded border, and beaded chest halter with fluttering ribbons. The identity of the Sasanian king on this plate is uncertain. His crown identifies him as either Peroz (r. 459-484) or Kavad I (r. 488-497, 499-531) Sasanian silver bowls were usually hammered into shape and then decorated in various complex techniques. On this plate, separate pieces of silver were inserted into lips cut up from the plate to provide high relief. The vessel was then gilded using an amalgam of mercury and gold, which could be painted onto the surface, and niello—a metallic alloy of sulfur and silver—was inlaid. The result was a vessel of varied surface contours and colors.|Location created: Iran, said to be from Qazvin.|Date created: ca.

It is constructed from red twill weave silk made at a Palermo, Sicily Muslim textile workshop. The almost Central Asian style lions attacking camels, reminiscent of the art of the ancient Scythes, and the centrally placed Tree of Life, all typically Middle Eastern motifs, are embroidered in a mix of colored silks and masses of couched gold wrapped threads. Kufic Arabic script along the curved bottom edge reads 'This mantle was worked in the most magnificent clothing workshop and is connected with the desire and hopes, felicitous days and nights without cease or change, with authority, with honor and felicity, assurances of trust, reverent care, protection, good destiny, freedom from harm, triumph and livelihood in the capital city of Sicily in the year 528' (or 1133/34 in the Gregorian calendar) Roger founded the short-lived but culturally rich kingdom of Norman Sicily, where Christians, Muslims and Jews comfortably mingled cultures, arts, and trade.

Its minaret, the Malwiya Tower, is a spiraling cone 52 meters high and 33 meters wide with a spiral ramp. The mosque had 17 aisles, and its walls were paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass. It was part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. The mosque itself was destroyed in 1278 after the Hulagu Khan invasion of Iraq. Only the outer wall and its minaret remain.

Unlike earlier mosques, this structure's rectilinear proportions created a vast empty space. On three sides of the court there is a single-aisled portico.
