  <dc:description>The Utrecht Psalter is a ninth-century illuminated psalter which is a key masterpiece of Carolingian art. It is lavishly illustrated with lively pen and ink drawings for each psalm. The miniatures consist of outline drawings in plain bistre, a technique which gained popularity in the Carolingian Renaissance; it was cheaper than full colored illustrations and quicker to produce. However the Gospel book still remained the main focus of illumination at this period, and the Utrecht Psalter is highly unusual both in the number of illustrations, their size, and the large groups of small figures they contain. The style of the outline drawings is dramatic, marked by activity, leaping creatures and fluttering folds of drapery set in faintly sketched landscape backgrounds stretching the full span of a page. Several different episodes may be shown in an illustration, some interpreting the text very literally, indeed over-literally in typical medieval fashion, others building on an association with the text to create elaborate images, including New Testament scenes or motifs from Christian iconography. MS. 32, fol.13r.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The king as hunter had become a standard royal image on silver plates during the reign of Shapur II (A.D. 310-379) The theme, symbolizing the prowess of Sasanian rulers, was used to decorate these royal plates, which were often sent as gifts to neighboring courts. The king has various royal attributes: a crown and fillet, covered globe, nimbus with beaded border, and beaded chest halter with fluttering ribbons. The identity of the Sasanian king on this plate is uncertain. His crown identifies him as either Peroz (r. 459-484) or Kavad I (r. 488-497, 499-531) Sasanian silver bowls were usually hammered into shape and then decorated in various complex techniques. On this plate, separate pieces of silver were inserted into lips cut up from the plate to provide high relief. The vessel was then gilded using an amalgam of mercury and gold, which could be painted onto the surface, and niello&#x2014;a metallic alloy of sulfur and silver&#x2014;was inlaid. The result was a vessel of varied surface contours and colors.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In an address to the citizens of Damascus, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705-715) proclaimed: "Inhabitants of Damascus, four things give you a marked superiority over the rest of the world: your climate, your water, your fruits, and your baths. To these I wanted to add a fifth: this mosque."1 The construction of the Great Mosque (or Friday Mosque) of Damascus was a means of establishing the permanence of the Umayyad rule, a significant gesture in a city that had been under Persian rule from 612-628 and then Arab rule from 635-661. The mosque was unlike any before it, and its form was mirrored by later imperial mosques. Of particular importance are the mosaics that decorate the mosque. Attributed to Byzantine workmen, these mosaics appear on the prayer hall, the inner side of the perimeter walls, and the court facades. Flowing rivers, fantastic houses, and richly foliate trees of variegated greens ornament the golden background. The motifs in these mosaics are similar to those of the Dome of the Rock, which predate this monument by fifteen years.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This coronation mantle was likely made for the Norman ruler Roger II in 1133/34 in the royal workshop in Palermo. It is constructed from red twill weave silk made at a Palermo, Sicily Muslim textile workshop. The almost Central Asian style lions attacking camels, reminiscent of the art of the ancient Scythes, and the centrally placed Tree of Life, all typically Middle Eastern motifs, are embroidered in a mix of colored silks and masses of couched gold wrapped threads. Kufic Arabic script along the curved bottom edge reads "This mantle was worked in the most magnificent clothing workshop and is connected with the desire and hopes, felicitous days and nights without cease or change, with authority, with honor and felicity, assurances of trust, reverent care, protection, good destiny, freedom from harm, triumph and livelihood in the capital city of Sicily in the year 528" (or 1133/34 in the Gregorian calendar) Roger founded the short-lived but culturally rich kingdom of Norman Sicily, where Christians, Muslims and Jews comfortably mingled cultures, arts, and trade. Because he allowed the often conflicting religions to live in harmony in Norman Sicily, Roger was suspected by some Europeans of being a secret Muslim.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Great Mosque of Samarra is a ninth-century mosque located in Samarra, Iraq. The mosque was commissioned in 848 and completed in 851 by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil who reigned (in Samarra) from 847 until 861. Its minaret, the Malwiya Tower, is a spiraling cone 52 meters high and 33 meters wide with a spiral ramp. The mosque had 17 aisles, and its walls were paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass. It was part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. The mosque itself was destroyed in 1278 after the Hulagu Khan invasion of Iraq. Only the outer wall and its minaret remain. In 2005 the top of the Malwiya minaret was damaged by a bomb.</dc:description>

  <dc:creator>Trdat, active 10th century.</dc:creator>
  <dc:description>The Cathedral of Aniwas completed in 1001 by the architect Trdat in the ruined ancient Armenian capital of Ani, located in what is now the extreme eastern tip of Turkey, on the border with modern Armenia. It offers an example of a domed cruciform church within a rectangular plan, though both the dome and the drum supporting it are now missing, having collapsed in an earthquake in 1319. A further earthquake in 1988 caused the collapse of the north-west corner, and weakened all the west side. Tall blind arcades decorate the external walls, including the ruined drum. There is carved relief decoration around several windows. There are three entrances, for the prince (south), the patriarch (north) and the people (west); each originally had a porch. The eastern end presents on the exterior a flat wall with two tall triangular niches, but on the interior has a large central apse with two chambers on two stories to the sides only accessible through narrow doorways on the ground floor, and stairways to the upper floor spaces.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In an address to the citizens of Damascus, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705-715) proclaimed: "Inhabitants of Damascus, four things give you a marked superiority over the rest of the world: your climate, your water, your fruits, and your baths. To these I wanted to add a fifth: this mosque."1 The construction of the Great Mosque (or Friday Mosque) of Damascus was a means of establishing the permanence of the Umayyad rule, a significant gesture in a city that had been under Persian rule from 612-628 and then Arab rule from 635-661. The mosque was unlike any before it, and its form was mirrored by later imperial mosques. Of particular importance are the mosaics that decorate the mosque. Attributed to Byzantine workmen, these mosaics appear on the prayer hall, the inner side of the perimeter walls, and the court facades. Flowing rivers, fantastic houses, and richly foliate trees of variegated greens ornament the golden background. The motifs in these mosaics are similar to those of the Dome of the Rock, which predate this monument by fifteen years.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This limestone lintel, considered one of the masterpieces of Maya art, is one of a series of three panels from Structure 23 at Yaxchil&#xE1;n, where it was set above the left (south-east) doorway. The scene represents a bloodletting ritual performed by the king of Yaxchil&#xE1;n, Shield Jaguar the Great (681-742), and his wife, Lady K'ab'al Xook (Itzamnaaj Bahlen III) The king holds a flaming torch over his wife, who is pulling a thorny rope through her tongue. Scrolls of blood can be seen around her mouth. The first two glyphs in the text at the top of the lintel indicate the event and the date on which it took place, 24 October, AD 709 (5 Eb, 15 Mak in the Maya calendar)The last glyph represents the Emblem Glyph (that is, the city name in Maya hieroglyphs) of Yaxchil&#xE1;n. The text on the left of the panel contains the name and titles of Lady K'ab'al Xook. The lintel has traces of Maya blue, turquoise and red pigment.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Umayyad desert palaces show clearly the influence of earlier artistic traditions - both from the Byzantine Empire in the West, and the Sassanid Empire in the East, what is now modern Iran. This painting shows the influence of the art and mythology of the Sassanids. It covered the floor of the reception room in the east wing of Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi.The upper section shows two court minstrels playing musical instruments, a nai (a woodwind instrument) and an oud (a string instrument), beneath a pair of ornamented arches. The lower section portrays a clean-shaven hunter galloping on horseback. The hunter is dressed in Sassanid-style fashion; his head-scarf flying behind him, his bow and arrow are drawn tight for the catch. On the lower right-hand corner is a gazelle, running away while looking back. It is possible that this scene is based on a famous Persian epic, possibly Bahram Gur's Hunting Feats.</dc:description>

The mosque was unlike any before it, and its form was mirrored by later imperial mosques. Four minarets (all from different time periods) sit atop the four corners. Unlike earlier mosques, this structure's rectilinear proportions created a vast empty space. On three sides of the court there is a single-aisled portico. The fourth wall (known as the qibla3) has a long prayer hall that, similar to a Christian basilica, has an east-west axis.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Dating from the fourth century, this royal head, hammered from a single sheet of silver, with chased and repouss&#xE9; details, has parallels in imperial portraits made in the Roman West. The king wears simple ovoid earrings and a beaded necklace of Sasanian fashion. His powerful stare and characteristic arched nose seem to suggest that the artist was attempting to convey a sense of majesty rather than an individual likeness. The identity of the subject of such representations, in relief or in the round, can often be determined by comparison of facial features and details of the crown with those of kings portrayed on Sasanian coins of the period. In this case, however, the crescent that decorates the crenellated crown and the striated orb that rises above it have no exact parallel.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Few surviving Umayyad palaces present as much evidence for the types of decoration popular among the period's elite as does Khirbat al-Mafjar, a desert qusur, or fortified palace complex. The site features a palace, a mosque, a bath, and an audience hall, all of which are elaborately ornamented. This pavement mosaic in the reception hall of a lion attacking a gazelle underneath a blooming tree shows the continuing high-quality mosaics produced in the region into the early Islamic period.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Cathedral of Aniwas completed in 1001 by the architect Trdat in the ruined ancient Armenian capital of Ani, located in what is now the extreme eastern tip of Turkey, on the border with modern Armenia. It offers an example of a domed cruciform church within a rectangular plan, though both the dome and the drum supporting it are now missing, having collapsed in an earthquake in 1319. A further earthquake in 1988 caused the collapse of the north-west corner, and weakened all the west side. Tall blind arcades decorate the external walls, including the ruined drum. There is carved relief decoration around several windows. There are three entrances, for the prince (south), the patriarch (north) and the people (west); each originally had a porch. The eastern end presents on the exterior a flat wall with two tall triangular niches, but on the interior has a large central apse with two chambers on two stories to the sides only accessible through narrow doorways on the ground floor, and stairways to the upper floor spaces.</dc:description>
